The age group 20-24 is clearly a very profitable market segment. This segment consists of 44% of the total players in the video game and have also purchased $1114 dollars in total making this the highest revenue from any of the age groups. The age group 35-39 have the highest average total purchase per person which may indicate that this might be the most profitable age group. We need information on advertising and sales spending to determine if this age group should be more targeted.
While clearly there are more males using the videogame (84% vs 14% of females) and therefore bringing a higher revenue, the average total purchase is equal to females. This indicates that gender doesnâ€™t influence how much a player is willing to spend. 
Final Critic is the most profitable and most popular item. Not only it has the highest amount of purchases but because of its pricing it is the best product.
